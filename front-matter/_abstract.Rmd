This *R Markdown* template is for writing a University of Cambridge thesis. The 
template is built using Yihui Xie's `bookdown` package, with significant 
inspiration from Ulrik Lyngs's `oxforddown` and heavy reliance on Krishna 
Kumar's `phd-thesis-template` University of Cambridge \LaTeX\ template.

I hope this template proves useful for you!
